    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm just a human, I wouldn't worry about it too much.</p>

    <p>
      Okay, <em>fine</em>, I'll try. Professionally, I'm a software
      developer, but I have <a href="https://carrick.eu">another site</a>
      for that. Outside of that though, I still spend most of my waking
      life in front of a computer, and have done so for about as long
      as I can remember. That's not that I don't do other stuff.
      I boulder, sometimes hike, travel a little bit, and so on,
      but they don't feel so much as a defining part of my life as
      staring into a screen trying to make things happen.
    </p>

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is just a place for me to ramble about whatever
      comes to mind. Parts will be bloggy, talking about the
      boring stuff that happens in my life. Parts will be
      ill-thought out ramblings about politics or society that will
      undoubtedly get me cancelled. Anything else? Who knows?
    </p>
    <p>
        You may have noticed this site looks like garbage.
        I would prefer to call it oldschool, however.
        It uses only named colours (though I don't believe they're all
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors">web-safe</a>).
        I at least haven't added an intro page, but maybe one day I will add
        a gaudy hit counter, or perhaps even a guestbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find the code for the site on
      <a href="https://github.com/knyghty/clavicl.es">GitHub</a>,
      if you're so inclined.
    </p>
    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    <p>
      The starfield background image is taken from the beautiful 
      <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/">Cameron's World</a>,
      which provided a lot of inspiration for this site as well.
      I assume it's okay to "borrow" the image as all the content
      of the site was found on Geocities in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another inspiration for the site (not only the design but just
      the idea of having a place to ramble) is
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203081232/http://www.ulillillia.us/mainindex.shtml">
        Ulillillia's old website
      </a> &mdash; apparently he plans to relaunch it if he gets
      enough Patreon money, so go ahead and
      <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ulillillia">throw some money his way</a>
      if you like.
    </p>
    <p>The CSS for the neon heading on the homepage is taken almost verbatim from
      <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-neon-text-with-css/">CSS-Tricks</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the more boring acknowledgements, the site is authored using
      <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, which is the best
      Python static site generator I've found, imperfect though it is. The
      site is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> Pages.
