  <p>Other than the title, I don't have much to say.</p>

    Well, maybe one thing. If you're one of these morons on Twitter trying to be
    armchair detectives, armchair generals, or armchair anything else you have no experience in,
    please stop. You're embarrassing yourself, and you're embarrassing humanity.

    Also, if you're one of these morons on Twitter with braindead takes such as
    it being a good idea to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, I have the same
    message for you. I'm sure you mean well and all, but I really don't want to
    escalate an already horrfic situation into a more nuclear one.

  <p>But otherwise, <em>slava Ukraini!</em></p>
