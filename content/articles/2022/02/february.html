    I haven't written as much here as I'd like, but I'm keeping up with my original
    goals so I'm not going to call this a failure. Otherwise, the other goals are
    going well. The cube has been solved daily, and I've managed enough posts here
    and on the <a href="https://carrick.eu/">other site</a>.

    It's almost Valentine's Day. Always the tricky question of if I should not
    do anything and complain about it being a Hallmark holiday or something,
    or if I should do something nice. If you're non-binary, it's hard to know
    if the onus is on you to make the effort or not. I suppose I'm the "man" of
    the relationship, but gender norms are also pretty stupid, so whatever.

    Okay, back to useful things. I mentioned in the
    <a href="/posts/2022/Jan/01/new-year-new-site/">first post</a> that I would like
    to get into game development, as a hobby if nothing else. I got back to learning
    Unity. It's going to be slow as I only really have a few hours a week spare to
    spend on it. But any progress is progress.

    My mood has been a bit up and down lately. I should try to find some way to
    manage it better.

    I think it's clear now I don't have anything interesting to say, so I'll
    call it. I'll try to think of something interesting to write about for the next
    post. I don't want this to be purely a space for me to write about nothing.
