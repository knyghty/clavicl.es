    <p>In the first blow to my new year's resolutions, I forgot to take my
      Rubik's cube with me to France when visiting some of my girlfriend's
      family for a late Christmas celebration. I had it ready to go and I
      just forgot to put it in my bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology came to my rescue, as naturally, there's an app for that.
      Several actually, though the first few I tried were terrible.
      Knowing I'd only have to use it twice, I settled on the first
      functional app I found,
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JavedRehman.GameDev.RubiksCube3D">Rubik's Cube 3D</a>.
      It's not very good. It doesn't support multitouch, so getting the
      cube into a good rotation is very annoying. Sometimes the face
      I want to turn is not the one that does. But for two solves, it
      worked well enough that I could solve it in around 7 minutes,
      which is really slow but not as slow as I expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first of many short posts about nothing. Expect more.
      Let's call it a status update on my resolutions. So far, so good.
